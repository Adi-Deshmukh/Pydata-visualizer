## Next Steps

To complete the documentation update process:

1. **Rebuild HTML Documentation** (requires Sphinx):
   ```bash
   cd docs
   pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme myst-parser
   make clean
   make html
   ```

2. **Verify Generated HTML**:
   - Check that all .md files are rendered correctly
   - Verify code examples are formatted properly
   - Test internal links

3. **Update Version Numbers** (if needed):
   - pyproject.toml: version = "1.0.1"
   - __init__.py: __version__ = "1.0.1"
   - conf.py: release = '1.0.1'

4. **Deploy Documentation**:
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Trigger ReadTheDocs build (if configured)
   - Or deploy docs/build/html to documentation hosting
